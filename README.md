## Etymology statistics in Romanian


## Description

# Idea
Is Romanian a Latin language or a Slavic language?
Many who are unfamiliar with the language assume that it must be Slavic in nature, because of its geographical position. My project  gives the user the possibility of putting in its own corpus (in a .txt format) and to get some statistics, about how many porcent of the words in their corpus are from latin, slavic, dacian, greek, turkish or others origin. 
# Research Question:
Our hypothesis is that, despite its many unique aspects, Romanian is still a Romance languageat its core and the percentage of latin vocabulary in any corus will show that. 
#Literature review:
The numbers are not always consistent, but the majority of the Romanian language history textbooks agree that the vocabulary is up to 60-70% of Latin origin. Somewhere around 15 percent of the lexical items are of Slavic origin, but there are also words of Dacian, Turkish or even German and other origins.

We are aware of the problem of borrowings: thee a lot of words which may be seen as Latin origin, but are in fact borrowings from French and Italian or other languages. We are going to ignore this aspect. The two blog articles mentioned in the References ([1] [2]) approached this question from a
point of view of similarity with Latin, with other Romance languages and with other languages
from the Balkan Sprachbund.

## Data and resources:
- Text data in Romanian : corpus.txt 
- Lists of most common words of different origin in Romanian:
    -Slavic words
    -Dacian words
    -Greek words
    -Turkish words
    -words of other origin
- Spacy for tokenizing and obtaining the lemma

## Installation
All the imports are specified on the files.
I provided a requirements.txt document with all the necessary intallations. 

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you have any questions, you cant contact me at mirela-vasilica.ratoi@uzh.ch

## Project status
The project is finalized, but one could always add more words on the lists of words of different origins, as this are far of comprehensive.
